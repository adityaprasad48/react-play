App is built with react js. I have divided user interface into multiple components and used context api to store data at once and all methods so that we don't need pass data to all components and wrapped provider in index.js file.

Instruction to start app:-
npm install 
npm start


folder structure Inside src:--
/hooks :- for custom hooks
/contexts: if multiple contexts are there
/components: all components are in this folder

pakages used:--
axios: data fetching alternative like fetch method


What works:- 
Responsive done
api calling done
average show use formula done

what not works:-
autocomplete is not working didn't understand the problem. if gif images or screenshot of output included then i can make it working
